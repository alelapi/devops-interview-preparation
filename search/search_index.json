There are a few extra steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create the app from a template provided by AWS CDK - Each AWS CDK app should be in its own directory, with its own local module dependencies. Create a new directory for your app. Now initialize the app using the <code>cdk init</code> command, specifying the desired template (\u201capp\u201d) and programming language. The <code>cdk init</code> command creates a number of files and folders inside the created home directory to help you organize the source code for your AWS CDK app.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add code to the app to create resources within stacks - Add custom code as is needed for your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Build the app (optional) - In most programming environments, after making changes to your code, you\u2019d build (compile) it. This isn\u2019t strictly necessary with the AWS CDK\u2014the Toolkit does it for you so you can\u2019t forget. But you can still build manually whenever you want to catch syntax and type errors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template - Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template. The synthesis step catches logical errors in defining your AWS resources. If your app contains more than one stack, you\u2019d need to specify which stack(s) to synthesize.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy one or more stacks to your AWS account - It is optional (though good practice) to synthesize before deploying. The AWS CDK synthesizes your stack before each deployment. If your code has security implications, you\u2019ll see a summary of these and need to confirm them before deployment proceeds. <code>cdk deploy</code> is used to deploy the stack using CloudFormation templates. This command displays progress information as your stack is deployed.

This makes it easier to separate different environments or applications running within the same cluster. For example, you can have separate namespaces for different environments like:</p> </li> <li> <p><code>dev</code> for development</p> </li> <li><code>staging</code> for testing or pre-production</li> <li><code>prod</code> for production</li> </ol> <p>This isolation prevents conflicts between different applications or teams working on the same Kubernetes cluster, as resources in different namespaces do not overlap.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Access Control and Security:    Namespaces play an important role in securing your environment. Kubernetes integrates with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to allow fine-grained access control within a namespace. This means you can define policies that restrict users or services to only access resources within specific namespaces. This is particularly useful in multi-tenant environments where different teams or projects are using the same cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource Quotas and Limits:    Namespaces allow you to enforce resource quotas at the namespace level. This ensures that no namespace can consume more than its fair share of cluster resources such as CPU, memory, and storage. Resource quotas prevent one application or team from monopolizing the cluster\u2019s resources, thereby ensuring fair and predictable resource usage across different namespaces.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Isolation and Policies:    You can use network policies to control traffic between services within and across namespaces. This ensures that only certain applications or services can communicate with each other, which is crucial for securing the network and preventing unauthorized access between components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Environment Management:    By creating namespaces, you can manage multiple environments within a single Kubernetes cluster without needing separate clusters for each environment. For example, you can have a <code>dev</code> namespace for development, a <code>staging</code> namespace for testing, and a <code>prod</code> namespace for production, all within the same cluster. This simplifies cluster management, reducing operational overhead and resource waste.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"kubernetes/questions/can_you_explain_the_role_and_benefits_of_using_nam/#benefits-of-using-namespaces","title":"Benefits of Using Namespaces","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Logical Segmentation of Resources:    Namespaces provide a clean logical separation of resources within a cluster. They allow teams to independently manage and operate their respective applications while using shared infrastructure. For example, a team working on a development project can deploy and manage their application in the <code>dev</code> namespace, while another team working on production services can deploy to the <code>prod</code> namespace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved Resource Management:    With namespaces, Kubernetes administrators can set resource quotas and enforce limits on memory, CPU, and storage usage for each namespace. This ensures that resources are distributed fairly, preventing over-consumption by one team or application and allowing efficient scaling across multiple workloads.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Multi-Tenancy:    In multi-tenant environments, namespaces allow different teams or departments to use the same Kubernetes cluster while keeping their resources isolated. Each team can have its own namespace, where it can define its own set of services and configurations without affecting others. This is especially useful in large organizations or managed service providers who are serving multiple customers within a single cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Security:    Namespaces help enhance security in Kubernetes by restricting access to specific resources using RBAC. Users or service accounts are granted permissions only within the namespaces they need to access. Additionally, network policies can limit communication between namespaces, reducing the attack surface and helping to mitigate security risks in the cluster.</p> </li> <li> <p>Efficient Scaling and Management:    By using namespaces, you can manage scaling for different environments and applications more easily. For example, you can scale the resources allocated to a <code>prod</code> namespace differently from a <code>dev</code> namespace to ensure production services always have sufficient resources. Additionally, namespaces simplify the process of upgrading or managing services, as changes can be isolated to a specific namespace without impacting others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Name Collision Avoidance:    In large clusters with multiple teams working on different applications, namespaces help prevent naming conflicts. Different teams can use the same resource names within their respective namespaces (e.g., a <code>frontend</code> service), and Kubernetes will treat them as separate resources, preventing conflicts.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"kubernetes/questions/can_you_explain_the_role_and_benefits_of_using_nam/#example-use-cases-for-namespaces","title":"Example Use Cases for Namespaces","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Multi-Tenant Clusters:    A managed Kubernetes cluster can have multiple namespaces for different customers or teams, allowing each tenant to deploy and manage their applications independently while sharing the same infrastructure.
