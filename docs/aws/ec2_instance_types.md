# AWS EC2 Instance types

- **Dedicated Instances** - Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at a hardware level, even if those accounts are linked to a single-payer account. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not Dedicated Instances.

- **Spot Instances** - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Your Spot Instance runs whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot price. Any instance present with unused capacity will be allocated.

- **Dedicated Hosts** - An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing software licenses on EC2 instances. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server. This option is costlier than the Dedicated Instance.

- **On-Demand Instances** - With On-Demand Instances, you pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments. You have full control over its lifecycle—you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. Hardware isolation is not possible and on-demand has one of the costliest instance charges.
