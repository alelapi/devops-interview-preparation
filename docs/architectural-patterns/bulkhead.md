# Bulkhead Pattern

## **Description**

The Bulkhead Pattern is a resilience pattern that isolates resources (e.g., threads, connections) to prevent failures in one part of a system from affecting the entire application. Itâ€™s inspired by bulkheads in ships that compartmentalize sections to prevent flooding.

## **How It Works**

- Separate workloads into isolated compartments (e.g., thread pools, services).
- If one compartment fails, the others remain unaffected.

---

## **Advantages**

- **Fault Isolation**: Limits the impact of failures.
- **Improved Stability**: Protects critical components from being overwhelmed.

## **Challenges**

- **Resource Management**: Properly partitioning resources can be complex.
- **Overhead**: Requires additional infrastructure for isolation.

## **Example Use Case**

In a travel booking system:

- Payment, inventory, and notification services each have dedicated thread pools.
- A failure in the notification service does not impact payments or inventory.
