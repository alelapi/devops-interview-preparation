## Answer

## Answer

### Handling a Complex Rollback Scenario
1. **Pre-Rollback Preparations**:
   - Implement deployment strategies like **Blue-Green Deployments** or **Canary Releases**.
   - Ensure **backward-compatible database schema changes** for smooth rollbacks.
   - Create **application and data backups** before each deployment.

2. **Automated Rollbacks**:
   - Use tools like **Spinnaker**, **ArgoCD**, or Kubernetes commands (`kubectl rollout undo`) to manage rollbacks.
   - Monitor metrics like error rates or latency to trigger automated rollbacks.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Reconcile database changes by implementing **event sourcing** or **versioned data migrations**.
   - Use transactional operations to ensure consistent data states during rollbacks.

4. **Zero-Downtime Techniques**:
   - Gradually shift traffic using load balancers (e.g., AWS ALB, NGINX).
   - Leverage container orchestration tools to maintain service continuity.

### Tools:
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Datadog
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD
- **Backup**: Velero for Kubernetes
