# CodeDeploy

## Service Overview
AWS CodeDeploy is a robust deployment automation service designed to streamline application version deployments across diverse computing environments. It supports deployment to EC2 instances, on-premises servers, Lambda functions, and ECS services with sophisticated deployment control mechanisms.

## Core Deployment Capabilities
The service enables automated application deployments with built-in rollback capabilities, triggered either by deployment failures or CloudWatch Alarm conditions. Deployments are orchestrated through an `appspec.yml` configuration file, which defines precise deployment procedures.

## Deployment Platforms and Strategies

### EC2 and On-Premises Deployments
CodeDeploy supports comprehensive deployment approaches for traditional server environments, including:

#### Deployment Speed Configurations
- AllAtOnce: Fastest deployment with maximum potential downtime
- HalfAtATime: Reduces infrastructure capacity by 50%
- OneAtATime: Slowest method with minimal availability impact
- Custom: Percentage-based deployment control

#### Deployment Types
- In-Place Deployment: Updates existing infrastructure directly
- Blue/Green Deployment: Creates parallel infrastructure for zero-downtime transitions

### Lambda Function Deployments
CodeDeploy offers sophisticated traffic shifting mechanisms for Lambda functions:

#### Traffic Shift Strategies
- Linear Approaches: Gradual traffic increase over specified intervals
- Canary Deployments: Controlled percentage testing before full rollout
- Immediate Deployment: Instantaneous full traffic shift

### ECS Service Deployments
Specialized deployment automation for containerized applications:

#### Deployment Patterns
- Blue/Green Deployments exclusively
- Linear and Canary traffic shifting
- Immediate deployment options

## Agent and Permissions

### CodeDeploy Agent
A prerequisite agent must run on target EC2 instances, with:
- Automatic installation via Systems Manager
- Permissions to access deployment artifacts from Amazon S3

## Advanced Deployment Features

### Auto Scaling Group Integration
- Supports in-place and blue/green deployments
- Automated deployment for newly created instances
- Configurable old infrastructure retention

### Rollback Mechanisms
- Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- Manual rollback capabilities
- Deployment of last known good revision
- CloudWatch Alarm-triggered rollbacks

## Deployment Configuration
Deployments are defined through `appspec.yml`, specifying:
- Deployment targets
- Artifact locations
- Execution hooks
- Validation procedures

## Conclusion
AWS CodeDeploy provides a comprehensive, flexible deployment automation solution supporting multiple platforms and sophisticated deployment strategies.
