# Compliance Frameworks

## GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
European Union regulation that establishes strict requirements for processing personal data of EU citizens, including consent, data minimization, breach notifications, and the right to access/erase personal information.

## HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
US legislation that protects sensitive patient health information by establishing standards for privacy, security, and breach notifications in healthcare.

## PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
Security standard for organizations handling credit card information, requiring secure networks, vulnerability management, access controls, and regular testing.

## NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
US agency that develops cybersecurity frameworks, guidelines, and standards to help organizations assess and improve their security posture across various industries.

## CIS Benchmarks
Industry-standard configuration guidelines developed by the Center for Internet Security that provide best practices for securely configuring operating systems, cloud services, containers, and applications.

## FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program)
FedRAMP is a US government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

## Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) is a software development process that helps developers build more secure software by reducing the number and severity of vulnerabilities while reducing development cost.
**Key Practices:**
- Threat Modeling: Structured approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security risks
- Secure Coding Guidelines: Standards for writing code that's resistant to vulnerabilities
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Automated scanning during development
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Runtime security testing
- Security Reviews: Formal assessments at critical phases
- Penetration Testing: Simulated attacks to find vulnerabilities
