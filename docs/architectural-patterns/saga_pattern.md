# Saga Pattern

## **Description**

The Saga Pattern is a design pattern used to manage long-running business transactions in a distributed system. It breaks the transaction into a series of smaller steps, with each step executed by a service. If a failure occurs, compensating actions are triggered to roll back previous steps.

## **How It Works**

1. **Choreography**: Services communicate through events to execute the steps.
2. **Orchestration**: A central controller coordinates and manages the saga's steps.

---

## **Advantages**

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures eventual consistency in distributed systems.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Compensating actions handle failures gracefully.

## **Challenges**

- **Complexity**: Implementing compensating actions and managing workflows is challenging.
- **Debugging**: Harder to trace failures in large-scale sagas.

## **Example Use Case**

An e-commerce order process:

1. Order service places an order.
2. Inventory service reserves stock.
3. Payment service processes payment.
4. If payment fails, the compensating action releases the reserved stock.
