# How would you handle Docker container updates to minimize service disruption?

## Answer

## Answer

### Docker Containers vs. Virtual Machines
1. **Architecture**:
   - Docker containers share the host OS kernel, while VMs include a full guest OS.
   - Containers use lightweight runtimes (e.g., `containerd`), while VMs require a hypervisor.

2. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Containers are lightweight, starting in seconds, with minimal overhead.
   - VMs consume more resources as they emulate hardware and run a full OS.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Containers excel in microservices, ephemeral workloads, and CI/CD.
   - VMs are better for running monolithic applications requiring full OS isolation.

### Tools:
- Docker CLI, Docker Compose, Kubernetes for orchestration.
