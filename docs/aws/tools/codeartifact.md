# CodeArtifact

## Overview

Modern software development relies heavily on code dependencies, where software packages interconnect and depend on each other for successful builds. As development progresses, new dependencies are continuously created, making artifact management - the process of storing and retrieving these dependencies - a crucial aspect of the development lifecycle.

Traditionally, organizations needed to invest significant resources in setting up and maintaining their own artifact management systems. AWS CodeArtifact eliminates this overhead by providing a secure, scalable, and cost-effective artifact management solution specifically designed for software development teams.

## Integration with Package Managers

CodeArtifact offers seamless integration with popular dependency management tools that developers use in their daily workflows. The service supports a wide range of package managers including:

- Maven and Gradle for Java dependencies
- npm and yarn for JavaScript and Node.js packages
- twine and pip for Python packages
- NuGet for .NET dependencies

This broad compatibility ensures that developers can continue using their preferred tools while leveraging CodeArtifact's enterprise-grade capabilities. Furthermore, AWS CodeBuild can directly retrieve dependencies from CodeArtifact, streamlining the continuous integration process.

## Resource Policy and Access Management

CodeArtifact implements a straightforward but powerful access control mechanism through its resource policy feature. This policy framework enables cross-account access to CodeArtifact repositories, facilitating collaboration across different AWS accounts within an organization.

A notable characteristic of CodeArtifact's access control is its all-or-nothing approach to package access: when a principal (user or role) is granted access to a repository, they can either read all packages within that repository or none at all. This simplifies access management while ensuring consistent security controls across all packages within a repository.
