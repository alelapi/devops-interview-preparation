# Falco

## How Falco Works

Falco is an open-source cloud-native runtime security tool that functions as a behavioral monitoring system for containers, Kubernetes, and cloud environments. Here's how it works:

1. **System Call Monitoring**: Falco taps into the Linux kernel using either kernel modules or eBPF to observe system calls in real-time.

2. **Rule-Based Detection**: It compares observed activities against a set of predefined rules written in a specific syntax.

3. **Event Alerting**: When activities match potentially malicious or suspicious patterns, Falco generates alerts through various outputs (stdout, files, syslog, etc.).

## Example Falco Rules

```yaml
# Detect privilege escalation via setuid programs
- rule: Privilege Escalation via Setuid Binary
  desc: Detect privilege escalation attempts using setuid binaries
  condition: spawned_process and proc.name in (setuid_binaries) and not proc.uid=0
  output: "Privilege escalation via setuid binary (user=%user.name command=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING

# Detect unexpected outbound network connections from a database container
- rule: Unexpected Outbound Connection from Database
  desc: Detect unexpected network traffic from database pods
  condition: outbound and container.image.repository contains "postgres" and not dest.port in (5432)
  output: "Unexpected outbound connection from database (command=%proc.cmdline connection=%fd.name)"
  priority: NOTICE

# Detect shell spawned by a web server process
- rule: Shell Spawned by Web Server
  desc: Detect shells spawned by web servers, potential command injection
  condition: spawned_process and proc.name in (shell_binaries) and proc.pname in (web_server_binaries)
  output: "Shell spawned by web server (user=%user.name web=%proc.pname shell=%proc.name parent=%proc.pname cmdline=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: WARNING
```

These rules detect common attack patterns like privilege escalation, unusual network connections, and web server shells that might indicate compromise. Falco's real power is its ability to monitor cloud-native environments in real-time and alert on suspicious behaviors according to customizable rules.
