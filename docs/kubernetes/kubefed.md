# KubeFed (Kubernetes Federation)

**KubeFed** is a Kubernetes project that enables **federation** of multiple Kubernetes clusters. Federation allows you to manage multiple clusters as a single entity, providing centralized control over the resources and configurations across clusters.

## Key Features of KubeFed

1. **Multi-Cluster Management**:

   - Allows administrators to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control plane.
   - Synchronizes resources and configurations across clusters.

2. **Workload Distribution**:

   - Enables workload distribution across clusters for improved availability, fault tolerance, and geographic coverage.

3. **Cross-Cluster Resource Sharing**:

   - Allows shared resources, such as ConfigMaps and Secrets, to be replicated across clusters.

4. **Policy Enforcement**:
   - Ensures consistent policies and configurations across all federated clusters.

## Use Cases

- Disaster recovery and high availability by distributing workloads across multiple regions.
- Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud deployments to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Scaling workloads geographically to reduce latency for end-users.

## How It Works

- **Control Plane**: A central KubeFed control plane manages multiple clusters.
- **Federated Resources**: Resources such as Deployments, Services, or ConfigMaps are created in a federated namespace and propagated to member clusters.

## Example: Federated Deployment

A Deployment managed by KubeFed can run replicas of an application across three clusters (e.g., one in the US, one in Europe, and one in Asia).
