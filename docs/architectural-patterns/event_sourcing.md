# Event Sourcing Pattern

## **Description**

Event Sourcing is a design pattern where state changes in a system are stored as a series of immutable events. The current state is derived by replaying these events in sequence, rather than storing the state directly.

---

## **How It Works**

1. Events are generated for each state change (e.g., "Order Placed").
2. Events are persisted to an event store.
3. The system reconstructs state by replaying events from the store.

## **Advantages**

- **Auditability**: Provides a complete history of state changes.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles high volumes of write operations.

## **Challenges**

- **Complexity**: Rebuilding state and handling event evolution can be tricky.
- **Storage**: Large event histories may require significant storage.

## **Example Use Case**

A banking application:

- Events: "Account Created", "Deposit Made", "Withdrawal Made".
- State reconstruction: Replaying events rebuilds the account balance.
