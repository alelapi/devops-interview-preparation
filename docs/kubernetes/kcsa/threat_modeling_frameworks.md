# Threat Modeling Framework

Threat modeling for Kubernetes involves a structured approach to identifying, categorizing, and mitigating potential security threats.

## STRIDE

STRIDE is a commonly used threat modeling framework that can be effectively applied to Kubernetes:

- **Spoofing**: Unauthorized access using stolen credentials or impersonating legitimate Kubernetes components
- **Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of Kubernetes resources, configurations, or container images
- **Repudiation**: Lack of audit trails for actions performed in the cluster
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data in pods, secrets, or ConfigMaps
- **Denial of Service**: Attacks that make Kubernetes services unavailable
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining higher levels of access than intended

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It's a comprehensive framework that systematically documents cyber adversary behavior.

#### Tactical Categories

- **Initial Access**: Methods attackers use to first enter a network or system, such as phishing emails, exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, or using stolen credentials.
- **Execution**: Techniques for running malicious code on a compromised system, including command-line interfaces, scripts, or scheduled tasks to execute the attacker's code.
- **Persistence**: Methods to maintain access to systems despite reboots or credential changes, including backdoors, registry modifications, or startup scripts that ensure attackers can return.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques to gain higher-level permissions, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or manipulating access tokens to obtain administrative rights needed for further attack activities.
- **Defense Evasion**: Methods to avoid detection, including disabling security tools, clearing logs, encrypting malicious payloads, or disguising malicious activity as legitimate processes.
