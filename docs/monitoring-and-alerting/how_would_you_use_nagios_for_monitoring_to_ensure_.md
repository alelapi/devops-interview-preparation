## Answer

## Answer

### Monitoring and Alerting for High Availability
1. **Key Metrics**:
   - Monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, latency, and error rates.

2. **Tools**:
   - **Prometheus**: Collects and queries time-series data.
   - **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics on customizable dashboards.
   - **Nagios**: Monitors uptime and critical infrastructure.

3. **Alerting Strategies**:
   - Set thresholds for critical metrics.
   - Use tools like PagerDuty for escalations.

### Example:
