# AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool designed to help AWS customers optimize their cloud environments. It provides real-time guidance on improving the performance, security, cost efficiency, fault tolerance, and service limits of AWS resources.

## **Key Features**

### 1. **Best Practices Checks**
Trusted Advisor evaluates your AWS environment against a set of best practices in five categories:
- **Cost Optimization:** Identify underutilized or idle resources to reduce costs.
- **Performance:** Improve the performance of your applications.
- **Security:** Enhance security by identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Increase system availability and reduce downtime.
- **Service Limits:** Monitor usage to prevent service interruptions caused by resource limits.

### 2. **Personalized Recommendations**
Trusted Advisor provides tailored recommendations based on your AWS environment, enabling proactive management of resources.

### 3. **Actionable Insights**
Each recommendation includes detailed steps to resolve the identified issues, making it easy to implement best practices.

### 4. **Integration with AWS Services**
- **AWS Organizations:** Centralized management for multi-account environments.
- **AWS Support Plans:** Access to additional checks and features with Business or Enterprise Support plans.
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Set up alarms for specific Trusted Advisor metrics.

### 5. **Automated Notifications**
Receive regular updates and notifications about your environment's health.

## **Core Checks**

### **Cost Optimization**
- Identify idle or underutilized EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and load balancers.
- Recommend reserved instance purchases for cost savings.

### **Performance**
- Monitor high-utilization EC2 instances and recommend scaling or upgrading.
- Evaluate Auto Scaling configurations for efficiency.

### **Security**
- Highlight open access permissions in security groups.
- Identify exposed IAM access keys.
- Ensure MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enabled for root accounts.

### **Fault Tolerance**
- Detect Amazon RDS backups not configured.
- Identify instances running on single Availability Zones.

### **Service Limits**
- Track usage against AWS service limits to avoid disruptions.
- Recommend actions to stay within limits or request increases.

## **Common Use Cases**

1. **Cost Reduction**
   - Identify unused resources like idle EC2 instances and unused EBS volumes to reduce costs.

2. **Improved Security**
   - Address misconfigured security groups or unused IAM credentials to strengthen security.

3. **Enhanced Performance**
   - Ensure application performance by scaling under-provisioned resources.

4. **Avoiding Downtime**
   - Proactively monitor service limits to avoid disruptions caused by exceeded quotas.

## **Best Practices**

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Set up a schedule to review Trusted Advisor recommendations regularly.

2. **Integrate with Automation Tools**
   - Use AWS Lambda or other automation tools to act on Trusted Advisor findings.

3. **Enable Notifications**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you about critical checks.

4. **Leverage AWS Organizations**
