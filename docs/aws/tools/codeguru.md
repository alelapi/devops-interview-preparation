# CodeGuru

## Overview

Amazon CodeGuru is a machine learning-powered service that provides automated code reviews and application performance monitoring. The service consists of two main components: CodeGuru Reviewer for static code analysis during development, and CodeGuru Profiler for runtime performance analysis in production environments.

## CodeGuru Reviewer

CodeGuru Reviewer leverages machine learning and automated reasoning to perform sophisticated code analysis. The service has been trained on millions of code reviews from thousands of open-source and Amazon repositories, incorporating extensive real-world experience into its analysis capabilities.

The reviewer excels at identifying critical issues that might otherwise go unnoticed, including:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks
- Input validation problems
- Deviations from coding best practices
- Hard-to-detect bugs

Currently, CodeGuru Reviewer supports Java and Python codebases and integrates seamlessly with popular version control systems including GitHub and Bitbucket.

## CodeGuru Profiler

CodeGuru Profiler provides deep insights into application runtime behavior, helping developers understand and optimize their applications' performance characteristics. This component is particularly valuable for identifying resource-intensive operations, such as excessive CPU usage in routine operations like logging.

### Key Profiler Features

The profiler offers comprehensive performance optimization capabilities by helping developers identify and eliminate code inefficiencies. This leads to improved application performance, particularly in areas of CPU utilization, ultimately resulting in decreased compute costs.

Memory management is another crucial aspect of the profiler, which provides detailed heap summaries to help developers identify objects consuming excessive memory. The service also includes anomaly detection capabilities to identify unusual behavior patterns.

The profiler supports applications running both on AWS infrastructure and on-premise environments, with minimal performance impact on the monitored applications.

### Agent Configuration Parameters

CodeGuru Profiler's agent can be fine-tuned through several important configuration parameters:

**MaxStackDepth**: This parameter controls the maximum depth of stack traces that the profiler analyzes. For instance, in a call chain where method A calls B, which calls C, which then calls D (depth of 4), setting MaxStackDepth to 2 would limit analysis to methods A and B only.

**MemoryUsageLimitPercent**: Defines the maximum percentage of system memory that the profiler can utilize during its operation.

**MinimumTimeForReportingInMilliseconds**: Establishes the minimum interval between successive profiling reports, measured in milliseconds.

**ReportingIntervalInMilliseconds**: Determines how frequently the profiler sends its collected data, specified in milliseconds.

**SamplingIntervalInMilliseconds**: Controls how often the profiler collects sample data, measured in milliseconds. Reducing this value increases the sampling rate, providing more detailed profiling data at the cost of increased overhead.

### Performance Considerations

The profiler is designed to maintain minimal overhead on application performance, making it suitable for use in production environments. However, careful configuration of the sampling and reporting intervals is recommended to balance between detailed profiling data and system performance impact.

### Integration Capabilities

CodeGuru works alongside existing development tools and processes, making it an adaptable addition to various development environments. Its insights can be integrated into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate performance monitoring and code quality checks.
