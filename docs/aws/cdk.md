# Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

## Introduction

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure as code using familiar programming languages. Instead of writing JSON or YAML templates (like in CloudFormation), you can use programming languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, or Go to define your AWS infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

### Constructs
Constructs are the basic building blocks of CDK applications. They represent AWS resources or combinations of resources. There are three levels of constructs:

1. Level 1 (L1) - Low-level constructs that directly represent AWS CloudFormation resources
2. Level 2 (L2) - Higher-level constructs that provide defaults and best practices
3. Level 3 (L3) - Pattern constructs that represent multi-resource patterns for common architectures

### Stacks
Stacks are the unit of deployment in CDK. They contain constructs and map directly to CloudFormation stacks. Stacks handle:
- Resource grouping
- Deployment boundaries
- Permission boundaries
- Resource naming

### Apps
An App is the root construct that contains one or more stacks. It serves as the entry point of your CDK application and handles:
- Stack synthesis
- Asset bundling
- Deployment orchestration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>= 10.13.0)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- IDE or text editor of choice

### Installation
```bash
# Install CDK CLI globally
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Verify installation
cdk --version
```

### Project Initialization
```bash
# Create a new CDK project
mkdir my-cdk-app
cd my-cdk-app
cdk init app --language typescript
```

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example of creating an S3 bucket using CDK in TypeScript:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';

export class MyS3Stack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new s3.Bucket(this, 'MyFirstBucket', {
      versioned: true,
      encryption: s3.BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED,
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY
    });
  }
}
```

## Common Commands

- `cdk init` - Create a new CDK project
- `cdk synth` - Synthesize CloudFormation template
- `cdk diff` - Compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk deploy` - Deploy the stack to AWS
- `cdk destroy` - Destroy the stack

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep stacks focused and single-purpose
- Use constructs to encapsulate reusable components
- Leverage environment-specific configuration
- Follow programming language best practices

### Security
- Use IAM roles with least privilege
- Enable encryption by default
- Implement security groups properly
- Use VPC endpoints where appropriate

### Cost Management
- Use Tags for cost allocation
- Implement lifecycle rules for storage
- Consider reserved instances for stable workloads
- Monitor usage with AWS Cost Explorer

## Advanced Features

### Asset Bundling
CDK can bundle assets (like Lambda functions or Docker images) during deployment:
```typescript
new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_14_X,
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  handler: 'index.handler'
});
```

### Custom Constructs
Create reusable infrastructure patterns:
```typescript
export class CustomVpc extends Construct {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: CustomVpcProps) {
    super(scope, id);
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### Context and Environment
Handle environment-specific configurations:
```typescript
const environmentName = this.node.tryGetContext('environment');
```

## Workflow

The standard AWS CDK development workflow is similar to the workflow you're already familiar as a developer. There are a few extra steps:

1. Create the app from a template provided by AWS CDK - Each AWS CDK app should be in its own directory, with its own local module dependencies. Create a new directory for your app. Now initialize the app using the `cdk init` command, specifying the desired template ("app") and programming language. The `cdk init` command creates a number of files and folders inside the created home directory to help you organize the source code for your AWS CDK app.

2. Add code to the app to create resources within stacks - Add custom code as is needed for your application.

3. Build the app (optional) - In most programming environments, after making changes to your code, you'd build (compile) it. This isn't strictly necessary with the AWS CDKâ€”the Toolkit does it for you so you can't forget. But you can still build manually whenever you want to catch syntax and type errors.

4. Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template - Synthesize one or more stacks in the app to create an AWS CloudFormation template. The synthesis step catches logical errors in defining your AWS resources. If your app contains more than one stack, you'd need to specify which stack(s) to synthesize.

5. Deploy one or more stacks to your AWS account - It is optional (though good practice) to synthesize before deploying. The AWS CDK synthesizes your stack before each deployment. If your code has security implications, you'll see a summary of these and need to confirm them before deployment proceeds. `cdk deploy` is used to deploy the stack using CloudFormation templates. This command displays progress information as your stack is deployed. When it's done, the command prompt reappears.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check CloudFormation console for detailed error messages
   - Verify IAM permissions
   - Review resource limits

2. **Synthesis Issues**
   - Validate TypeScript/programming language syntax
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Verify construct properties

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Review CloudWatch logs
   - Check resource configurations
   - Verify network connectivity
