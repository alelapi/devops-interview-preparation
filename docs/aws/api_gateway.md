# Amazon API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service provided by AWS for creating, deploying, and managing APIs at any scale. It supports both RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs, enabling real-time two-way communication between applications.

## Key Characteristics of API Gateway

### **1. Fully Managed Service**

- Simplifies API lifecycle management, including creation, deployment, monitoring, and versioning.
- No need for managing infrastructure.

### **2. Multi-Protocol Support**

- Supports both RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs.
- Ideal for building real-time communication services like chat apps and live updates.

### **3. Scalability**

- Automatically scales to handle thousands of concurrent API calls.
- Provides consistent performance regardless of traffic volume.

### **4. Security**

- Supports multiple authentication mechanisms:
  - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - API keys
  - Amazon Cognito user pools
  - Lambda authorizers for custom authentication
- Integration with AWS WAF for protection against DDoS attacks and common web exploits.

### **5. Integration with AWS Services**

- Seamlessly integrates with AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Step Functions, and other AWS services.
- Acts as a front door for serverless and containerized applications.

### **6. Monitoring and Analytics**

- Provides built-in monitoring and logging via Amazon CloudWatch.
- Tracks metrics like latency, error rates, and request counts.
- Enables detailed request and response logging for debugging and analysis.

### **7. Custom Domain Names**

- Supports custom domain names for APIs.
- Allows configuring HTTPS endpoints with custom certificates.

### **8. Flexible Deployment Options**

- Supports multiple stages (e.g., dev, staging, production) for API deployment.
- Provides stage variables for dynamic configuration.

### **9. Stages**

- **Definition**: Stages represent different environments or versions of your API (e.g., development, testing, production).
- **Key Features**:
  - Each stage has its own URL endpoint.
  - Stages can be configured with unique settings, such as throttling limits, caching, and logging.
  - Stage variables allow dynamic configuration of stage-specific values, such as Lambda function ARNs.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies versioning and environment management.
  - Facilitates separate monitoring and troubleshooting for each stage.

### **10. Throttling and Quotas**

- Allows setting rate limits and burst limits to protect APIs from being overwhelmed.
- Offers quota settings to manage usage by API consumers.

### **11. Transformation and Validation**

- Supports request and response transformation using Velocity Template Language (VTL).
- Validates incoming requests against defined schemas.

### **12. Caching**

- Provides in-built caching for reducing latency and improving API performance.
- Cache sizes range from 0.5 GB to 237 GB.

### **13. Versioning**

- Allows managing multiple API versions simultaneously.
- Helps in seamless API transitions and backward compatibility.

### **14. Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**

- Pricing based on the number of API calls, data transfer out, and caching.
- No upfront costs or long-term commitments.

### **15. Multi-Region Deployment**

- Supports deploying APIs in multiple AWS regions.
- Ensures high availability and low latency for global users.

### **16. Developer Portal**

- Provides an open-source developer portal for onboarding and managing API consumers.
- Enables API key generation, documentation browsing, and API testing.
