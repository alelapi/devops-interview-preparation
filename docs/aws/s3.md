# Simple Storage Service (S3)

## Introduction

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. It can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, making it a versatile solution for backup, archiving, content distribution, and data lakes.

## Core Concepts

### Buckets
- Containers for objects stored in S3
- Must have a globally unique name
- Region-specific
- No limit to objects in a bucket
- Flat structure (no real hierarchy)

### Objects
- Basic storage unit in S3
- Consists of:
  - Data (the file)
  - Key (the file name)
  - Metadata (data about the data)
  - Version ID (if versioning enabled)
- Size limits:
  - Single object: 5TB
  - Single PUT: 5GB

## Data Protection

### Versioning
```json
{
    "VersioningConfiguration": {
        "Status": "Enabled"
    }
}
```
- Maintains multiple versions of objects
- Protects against accidental deletions
- Can be suspended but not disabled
- Increases storage costs

### Replication
Types:
1. Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
2. Same-Region Replication (SRR)

```json
{
    "ReplicationConfiguration": {
        "Role": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/role-name",
        "Rules": [
            {
                "Status": "Enabled",
                "Destination": {
                    "Bucket": "arn:aws:s3:::destination-bucket"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Object Lock
- Write-once-read-many (WORM)
- Retention periods

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
- Legacy access control mechanism
- Granular permissions at object level

## S3 Encryption

Amazon S3 provides robust object encryption capabilities through multiple approaches. Encryption ensures data confidentiality and protection at rest, with users having flexibility in key management and encryption strategies.

### Server-Side Encryption (SSE) - Encryption at rest

1. #### SSE-S3 (AWS-Managed Encryption)
AWS provides default server-side encryption using keys entirely managed by Amazon. This method uses AES-256 encryption and is automatically enabled for new buckets and objects. When using SSE-S3, AWS handles all aspects of key management, simplifying the encryption process for users.
Must set header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"`

2. #### SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service)
This encryption method leverages AWS Key Management Service for enhanced control and auditability. Users can manage encryption keys through KMS, enabling granular control and the ability to track key usage via CloudTrail. However, users should be aware of KMS request quotas, which vary by region and may require service quota increases for high-volume operations.
Must set header `"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"`

Limitation:
- If you use SSE-KMS, you may be impacted by the KMS limits: when you upload, it calls the `GenerateDataKey` KMS API, when you download, it calls the `Decrypt` KMS API
- Count towards the KMS quota per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region)
- You can request a quota increase using the Service Quotas Console


3. #### SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)
For organizations requiring complete key management control, SSE-C allows customers to manage their encryption keys externally from AWS. Critical requirements include using HTTPS and providing encryption keys with every HTTP request. Importantly, Amazon S3 does not store the provided encryption keys, maintaining maximum customer control.

### Client-Side Encryption

In client-side encryption, data is encrypted by the client before transmission to Amazon S3. Clients use specialized libraries like the Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library, managing the entire encryption lifecycle independently. This approach provides maximum control but requires more complex implementation.

## Encryption in Transit

Amazon S3 supports encryption during data transfer through SSL/TLS. While HTTP endpoints exist, HTTPS is strongly recommended and mandatory for certain encryption methods like SSE-C. Most clients default to the encrypted HTTPS endpoint, ensuring secure data transmission.

## Access Control and Security Mechanisms

### Bucket Policies and Encryption Enforcement

S3 allows enforcing encryption through bucket policies. Administrators can configure policies to reject API calls that do not include proper encryption headers, ensuring all stored objects meet security requirements. These policies are evaluated before default encryption settings.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete

For critical buckets, MFA Delete provides an additional security layer. Bucket owners can require multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations like permanently deleting object versions or suspending versioning.

### Access Points

S3 Access Points simplify security management by providing:
- Unique DNS names
- Granular access policies
- VPC-origin configurations for enhanced network security

### Logging and Auditing

S3 supports comprehensive access logging, recording all bucket access attempts regardless of authorization status. These logs can be stored in a separate S3 bucket and analyzed using various data tools, enabling thorough security monitoring.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

S3 supports CORS, allowing controlled cross-origin web browser requests. By configuring CORS headers, administrators can specify which origins can interact with S3 resources, enhancing web application security.

## Pre-Signed URLs

For temporary, controlled access, S3 generates pre-signed URLs with configurable expiration. These URLs inherit the permissions of the generating user, enabling secure, time-limited access to specific objects.

## Advanced Security Features: S3 Object Lambda

S3 Object Lambda introduces dynamic object transformation using AWS Lambda functions. This feature allows real-time modifications like:
- Redacting sensitive information
- Converting data formats
- Dynamically modifying object content before retrieval

By integrating these security strategies, AWS S3 provides a comprehensive, flexible approach to data protection, giving users multiple options to secure their cloud storage infrastructure.

        {
            "Status": "Enabled",
            "Transition": {
                "Days": 30,
                "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
