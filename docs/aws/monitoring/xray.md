# X-Ray

## Introduction

AWS X-Ray provides robust troubleshooting capabilities for complex distributed systems. It enables developers to understand microservice architectures by tracing requests across different services, identifying performance bottlenecks, and pinpointing service issues.

### Architecture
```
Application → X-Ray SDK → X-Ray Daemon → X-Ray API
    (2000/UDP)         (443/HTTPS)
```

## Compatibility and Supported Platforms

X-Ray integrates seamlessly with multiple AWS services and platforms, including:
- AWS Lambda
- Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon ECS
- Elastic Load Balancers
- API Gateway
- EC2 Instances
- On-premise application servers

## Tracing Mechanism

Tracing in X-Ray represents an end-to-end method of following a request through complex systems. Each component adds its own trace, composed of segments and subsegments. Developers can enhance traces with annotations to provide additional contextual information.

## Tracing Strategies

X-Ray supports flexible tracing approaches:
- Comprehensive tracing of every request
- Sampling requests based on percentage or rate per minute

## Security Features

The service implements robust security measures:
- IAM for authorization
- AWS KMS for encryption at rest

## Enabling X-Ray

Implementing X-Ray requires two primary steps:

1. Code Instrumentation
   - Import AWS X-Ray SDK in supported languages (Java, Python, Go, Node.js, .NET)
   - Minimal code modification needed
   - Automatic capture of AWS service calls, HTTP/HTTPS requests, database interactions, and queue calls

2. Daemon Configuration
   - Install X-Ray daemon or enable AWS integration
   - Daemon functions as a low-level UDP packet interceptor
   - AWS Lambda and other services automatically run the X-Ray daemon

## Key Concepts

- Segments: Performance data from each application/service
- Subsegments: Detailed breakdown of segments
- Traces: Collected segments forming end-to-end request tracking
- Sampling: Mechanism to reduce trace volume and control costs
- Annotations: Indexed key-value pairs for trace filtering
- Metadata: Non-indexed key-value pairs

## Sampling Rules

X-Ray provides sophisticated sampling control:
- Default: First request per second, five percent of additional requests
- Configurable rules without code changes
- Reservoir ensures at least one trace per second
- Customizable sampling rates and rules

## APIs and Integrations

X-Ray offers comprehensive APIs:
- Write APIs for uploading trace segments
- Read APIs for retrieving trace information
- GetServiceGraph for generating service maps
- BatchGetTraces for detailed trace retrieval

## Platform-Specific Implementation

For platforms like Elastic Beanstalk:
- X-Ray daemon included in platform
- Configurable through console or configuration files
- Requires proper IAM instance profile permissions

## Cross-Account Tracing

X-Ray supports cross-account tracing by:
- Configuring daemon to send traces between accounts
- Requiring correct IAM role assumptions
- Enabling centralized application performance monitoring

## Visualization and Troubleshooting

X-Ray generates graphical service maps that transform complex trace data into intuitive visualizations, making performance analysis accessible to both technical and non-technical team members.
